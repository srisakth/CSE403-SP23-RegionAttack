## Policies
* Slack: All messaging regarding the project should happen via Slack. As long as it is concerning the project as a whole and is relevant for everything the Project channel is the go-to place. Bigger blocks of content should be discussed within a single thread that started the discussion.
Only in case of, for example, deep technical questions between team members we prefer to use the private channels such that the team channel does not get populated with irrelevant (in the big picture) stuff.
* Notion: We will use the Notion page for the organization of the project. We will keep track of to-do's, requirements, and a schedule.
Tasks are created only by Yanick Schimpf and by default assigned to Yanick Schimpf. As soon as the task was discussed with the team and an assignee was chosen the task is assigned to the respective team member. If not specified differently by the tasks deadline, a task is due by the end of the respective week it is placed into.
Tasks, if a category applies to them, may start with the prefixes:
  - PM - denoting product management tasks
  - BE - denoting backend tasks
  - FE - denoting frontend tasks
  - Bug - denoting a Bug (might be migrated to GitHub Issues)
